# Predictive Modeling for Sales and Demand Forecasting using Time Series Data

This project implements a time series-based predictive model to forecast future sales and demand using historical retail data. The model utilizes various statistical and machine learning techniques to analyze patterns in past data and generate accurate forecasts.

## 📁 Dataset

- `train.csv`: Contains historical sales data including features such as date, store ID, item ID, and sales quantity.

## 📌 Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of time-series sales data.
- Forecasting models using machine learning (like ARIMA, SARIMA, LSTM, or other regressors).
- Model performance evaluation.
- Visualization of actual vs. predicted sales.

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RAVEENRAJC/sales-demand-forecasting.git
   cd sales-demand-forecasting
